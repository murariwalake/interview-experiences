Round 1:
Tell me about yourself
Tell me about string pool, and why its introduced in java
why string is immutable?
Tell me about Exception hierarchy 
Tell me about HashMap and internal working of HashMap
Tell me when to use ArrayList and when to use LinkedList
Asked me to create immutable class with String and HashMap<String, List> as properties of that class. He was concerned about deep copy of map

Asked to implement ATM.
Method: public Map<Integer> getDenominations(Integer amount) 
Above method will take integer as input and returns map of notes and its count.
ATM has infinite number of 100, 200, 500, and 2000 notes, when user enters amount, it has to return mao of notes and its count. Also have to validate the input.

Ex:
Input: 5900
Output [2000:2, 500:3 200: 2, 100:0]

Asked to write TestClass for it. He was concerned about assertXXX methods.

Tell me about design pattern that you used in current project, or tell me design patterns you aware. We were using factory design pattern in current project so I explained about it.




class ATM{
	public static ArrayList<Integer> notes;// 100, 200, 500, 2000
	
	static{
		notes = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		notes.add(2000);
		notes.add(500);
		notes.add(200);
		notes.add(100);
		
	}

	public static ArrayList<Integer> getDenominations(Integer amount)Throws ATMException{
		validateAmount(amount);
		
		ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
		for(int i = 0; i<notes.size() && amount > 0; i++){
			while(amount >= notes.get(i)){
				result.add(notes.get(i));
				amount -=  notes.get(i);
			}
			
		}

		return result;		
		
		
		
	}

	protected void validateAmount(Integer amount)Throws ATMException{
		if(amount <= 0)
			new ATMException("Invalid input: Amount must be greater than zero");

		if(amount % 100 != 0)	
			new ATMException("Invalid input: Amount must multiple of 100");

	}

}


public ATMTest{
	
	@Test(timeout=120000)
	public void testGetDenominationsPositive(){
		Integer sum = 0;
		ArrayList<Integer> result = getDenominations(8700);
		for(Integer amount : result)
			sum += amount;
		assetEquals(sum, 8700);
		
		
	}

	@Test(timeout=120000)
	public void testGetDenominationsNegative(){
		Integer sum = 0;
		try{
			getDenominations(-200);
		}catch()
		
		
		
	}
	

}

Round 2: Technical
11-Aug-2021

Introduce yourself, tell me about projects you worked and tell me about what kind of qns you faced in last round.
What is encapsulation, what is use of it, how to achieve it in java
What is inheritance, what is use of it
What is deep copy how to do it in java
What is most parent class of all the classes in java
Tell few methods of Object class
*What are some magic words in java?
Why java is platform independent
Have you seen .class file, have you opened it?
Have you worked in JDBC?

What is authentication and authorization?
Difference bw get and post methods
Difference bw patch and post methods

If you have to introduce feature like updating the one of the product qty from your cart, which method you use get post put or patch

asked to code for below problems
Given two elements write code to find least common transistor in the binary tree which has unique elements.

Given array of unique integers and target sum, find pair whose sum is equal to target sum. O(n) time and space complexity is expected.

I was able to answer all the qn except magic words in java, and solved both coding qns.
Interviewer was trying to go deeper as much as I was able to answer them.
