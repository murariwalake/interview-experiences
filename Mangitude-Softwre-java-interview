1st round: 1 to 1 Coding round 18-Oct-2021
1. Tell me about tech stack that you have worked.
2. Asked me to share the screen and asked to code below coding qns.


Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (ie., any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
that node.
EXAMPLE
Input: the node c from the linked list a - >b- >c - >d - >e- >f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f

1. Asked few qns about core java
2. Asked to write code for below problem with O(n) time and O(1) space. I was able to give solution with O(n) time and O(n) space using stack

3rd round:
24-Sept-2021

1. Tell me about your professional journey.
2. There is an application where it has feature like, whatever you make changes during offline it will update when user goes to online. But there is issue that it is not updating data when user goes online,  what might be the possible root causes.

3. Gave below code and asked to how you will approach for solution.
/*<summary>
Waits till task execution is finished,cancelled and failed.
Keep checking the Task status till it turns to finished,cancelled and failed.
</summary>
*/
public string WaitTillTaskHasFinished()
{
	/* code within while loop is the solution that I gave, also I explained about join method from thread.*/
	while(true){

		taskStatus = ObjectTask.getStatus();
		if(taskStatus in (finished,cancelled and failed))
			break;
	}
	
}

on above scenario he also asked how will you handle if that task never completes, will you wait infinitely ?
4. Are you interested in onsite? if so then we don't provide much onsite opportunities.
5. He explained about the roles and kind of work I will be involving.

A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3
steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the
stairs.



public int numberOfWays(int n){
	int[] dp = new int[n+1];
	Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
	dp[1] = 1;
	dp[2] = 2;
	dp[3] = 4;
	
	return numberOfWaysHelper(n, dp);
	

}


public int numberOfWaysHelper(int n, int[] dp){
	if(n <= 3)
		return dp[n];
	dp[n] = numberOfWays(n-1) + numberOfWays(n-2) + numberOfWays(n-3);
	
	return dp[n];
